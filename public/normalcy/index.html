<p><strong>Normalcy</strong> <em>(noun)</em>: The condition of being normal. By liberating your minds from the effects of modernism, you will find normalcy is actually found in nature. Do not think of nature as the grass beneath your feet. It is very easy to label nature as &rsquo;that green stuff outside my apartment&rsquo; these days, but nature&rsquo;s original meaning as it is described by Lucretius in <em>De Rerum Natura</em> (The Nature of Things), is how the universe has come to be, how it continues to be and how the things in the universe propogate themselves.</p>
